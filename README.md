# Global-Sequence-Alignment

Here is the prompt for the programming assignment that was given in class:
1)	Ask the user to specify two sequences along with the scoring matrix (match, mismatch, and gap).
2)	Output the chart of DP calculation. Mark in the chart trace-back paths for all optimal alignment.
3)	Output all optimal alignments along with their respective alignment scores.


Here is how the program is run:
The code is run by prompting the user to enter two strings, the score for a matching string, and the score for a mismatch, as well as the score for a gap. A dynamic programming algorithm is then run to output the best score, as well as the path it took.
